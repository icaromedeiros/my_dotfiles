# Shell options

Well, I use Zsh on MacOS at other OS'es /shells in production.

At least, let's try to reuse aliases and envvars.

RUN FROM HERE!

- Install zsh with brew
- Install oh-my-zsh with `sh zsh/install.sh` and you will see the default ZSH prompt
- Run `sh install_configs.sh`
- Run `sh zsh/install_plugins.sh`
- Test with `source ~/.zshrc`
